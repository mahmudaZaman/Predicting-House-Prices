# Predicting House Prices

## Problem Statement

The Predicting House Prices project focuses on developing an accurate model to predict house prices based on essential features like square footage, the number of bedrooms, and location. This project empowers homebuyers, real estate professionals, and investors with valuable insights for making informed property-related decisions.

## Dataset

For this project, I utilized the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains a rich set of features and serves as the foundation for training and validating our house price prediction model.

## AWS Integration

The Predicting House Prices project seamlessly integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to leverage advanced tools and capabilities:

- **AWS SageMaker for Model Training**: I harnessed AWS SageMaker for streamlined model training and deployment. SageMaker offers powerful machine learning capabilities, ensuring the development of a robust prediction model.

- **Amazon S3 for Data Management**: The project efficiently stores and manages datasets in Amazon S3. This cloud-based storage solution guarantees data accessibility, scalability, and security.

## Deployment on AWS

The project culminates in the deployment of the house price prediction model as an AWS SageMaker endpoint. This endpoint facilitates real-time predictions, allowing users to obtain accurate property price estimates instantly.
