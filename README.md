# Predicting House Prices

## Problem Statement

The Predicting House Prices project focuses on developing an accurate model to predict house prices based on essential features like square footage, the number of bedrooms, and location. This project empowers homebuyers, real estate professionals, and investors with valuable insights for making informed property-related decisions.

## Dataset

In this project, I have employed the "Chicago House Price" dataset sourced from Kaggle, encompassing crucial information such as Price, Bedroom count, Living Space, Room details, Lot specifications, Tax data, Bathroom count, and Garage information. The diverse range of features in this dataset forms the basis for training and validating our house price prediction model.

## Models

This project involved a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the "Chicago House Price" dataset to understand, clean, and preprocess the data. Various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and RandomForest Regressor, were implemented to predict house prices. Notably, the RandomForest Regressor exhibited superior performance.

To enhance accessibility, a user-friendly House Prediction UI app was developed using Streamlit, leveraging the optimized RandomForest model. This app allows users to input key parameters and receive accurate predictions for house prices in Chicago suburbs, blending advanced machine learning with an intuitive interface for practical predictions.

## AWS Integration

The Predicting House Prices project seamlessly integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to leverage advanced tools and capabilities:
